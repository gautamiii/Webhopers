We have created the the custom contact form with required filed with validation.

if you want to defer all script except jquery.js , you can modify how wordpress loads javascript.

we will add script in functions.php file. OR by creating a custom plugin.

Once this script is added then we can check through wordpress site.

First need to go to site , then open the developer console then go to network tab , then reload the page. We can see there if javascript files are loading with defer.
